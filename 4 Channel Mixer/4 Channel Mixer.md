# 4 Channel Mixer

A simple mixer based on Eddy Bergman's [MIXER and PASSIVE ATTENUATOR in one](
https://www.eddybergman.com/2020/01/synthesizer-build-part-17-mixer-and.html)

I modified the stripboard layout to mount the potentiometers on the board and to use a 10pin power header. I also removed the switches from Eddy's design, preferring to use the jack switching on the outputs. So when a jack is plugged into OUT 1 - 3 it is removed from the mixed output on OUT 4. This is very similar behavior to the Befaco modules I have in my Synth.
