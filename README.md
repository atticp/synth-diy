# My DIY Synth

I am building a DIY Eurorack modular synthesizer as a hobby project. The rules for modules going in to the synth are as follows:

- I must have soldered the electronics on the module.
  - This means DIY Kits or Stripboard Modules Only  
- Try to learn something either electronics or synth related with each module
- Have fun!

This repository is storage of stripboard layouts and front panels for modules I have built. Feel free to use any layouts that are useful to your synth projects.
